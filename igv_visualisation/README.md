# IGV Visualisation of Mapping Results

This folder contains IGV screenshots comparing alignment results between barcode01 and barcode05 using both Illumina short reads and long reads.

## 1. Illumina Read Alignments (against `assembly_bar05.fasta`)

### 
**Figure 1.** Low coverage region on contig 11. Both barcode01 and barcode05 show very low or no alignments, suggesting a possible assembly gap or unmappable region. 

###
**Figure 2.** Normal coverage region on contig 9. Barcode01 and barcode05 show well-aligned reads with relatively even depth and minimal mismatches.

###
**Figure 3.** High coverage region on contig 13. Barcode05 exhibits substantially deeper coverage than barcode01, with visible differences in mismatches and insertions.

---

## 2. Long Read Alignments (against reference `CP001953.1`)

### 
**Figure 4.** Long read mapping of barcode01 to CP001953.1 (1â€“50,000 bp). Shows relatively consistent coverage with moderate variation.

###
**Figure 5.** Long read mapping of barcode05 to the same region. Shows slightly higher coverage and fewer gaps compared to barcode01.

These visualisations demonstrate structural and depth differences between barcode01 and barcode05 in specific genomic regions.

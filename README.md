#  Group 1 â€“ Barcode01 & Barcode05 Genome Project

This repo includes everything we did to assemble and annotate the genomes from barcode01 and barcode05.  
We used Illumina, long-read, and hybrid sequencing data. All our scripts, results, and notes are included here.

## Introduction

In this project, we:

- Assembled genomes for barcode01 and barcode05 using Illumina, long-read, and hybrid data
- Annotated the assemblies using Prokka
- Used Bandage to look at the genome structure

We compared different assembly methods and recorded our results for each barcode.  
Everything here is reproducible and organized by sample and method.
